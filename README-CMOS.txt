# CMOS VLSI Excess-3-to-binary converter
----------------------------------
# This was a simple project for my CSE354 course, 
CMOS VLSI Designs in my junior year in Yanbu University 
College
----------------------------------
# This was implmented using VERILOG and Electric, an EDA
tool used for VLSI CMOS Desings
